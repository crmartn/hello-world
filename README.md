# hello-world
Just following the instructions...

I'm completly new to any of this stuff. I'm actually trying to learn some programming to apply it to my research projects on Linguistics.
I was supposed to learn Python only, but I found a course on Golang and felt particularly interested about it. 
It's not my intention to become a full blown programmer, at all, but so far it seems quite fascinating. 
I live in Argentina at the moment, though I might move to Europe in the coming months, I'm still not sure which destination.
I have two possibilities, either Denmark or Ireland. Still haven't made up my mind. 
I like going to the gym, hanging out with friends, reading, traveling, learning languages (my major is in English, which is my favourite language).
